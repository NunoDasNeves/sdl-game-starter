Clean up - math.h inclusion - needs to link with libm on linux, no need to redefine pi
Clean up - decide about macros vs const - should use const more
Clean up - globals etc in platform code - most can be on the stack
Replace asserts with SDL_Assert
Add missing controller buttons to input
Think about platform independent mouse input (deliver x, y each frame? poll during the frame?)
Unify keyboard and controller input (this is game-dependent, but can cover a few cases in this repo)
Think about how other platforms may be added, whether to split windows/linux/etc into different files linked into the SDL layer
Think about graphics layer and where it goes - openGL, software rendering etc
Fullscreen and multiple monitor support
Cursor visibility
Active window detection
Audio fallback - detect possible skip and fade out quickly?
Variable framerate support (adjust depending on platform performance)
