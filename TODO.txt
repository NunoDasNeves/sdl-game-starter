Test new normalized gamepad analog input
Think about graphics layer and where it goes - openGL, software rendering etc
Fullscreen and multiple monitor support
Poll controller and mouse input in a separate thread at higher frequency (120hz+)
Cursor visibility
Active window detection
Audio separate function to get sound from game - avoids some problems with current method, probably not too hard from game side
Audio fallback - detect possible skip and fade out quickly?
Variable framerate support (adjust depending on platform performance)
