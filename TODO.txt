Test new normalized gamepad analog input
Think about platform independent mouse input
Unify keyboard and controller input (this is game-dependent, but can cover a few cases in this repo)
Think about how other platforms may be added, whether to split windows/linux/etc into different files linked into the SDL layer
Think about graphics layer and where it goes - openGL, software rendering etc
Fullscreen and multiple monitor support
Poll controller and mouse input in a separate thread at higher frequency (120hz+)
Cursor visibility
Active window detection
Audio separate function to get sound from game - avoids some problems with current method, probably not too hard from game side
Audio fallback - detect possible skip and fade out quickly?
Variable framerate support (adjust depending on platform performance)
